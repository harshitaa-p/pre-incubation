## 🎯 Download & Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Download Images
1. Visit Unsplash or Pexels
2. Search using the terms above
3. Download the **Large** or **Original** size
4. Save with descriptive names

### Step 2: Optimize Images
Before using, optimize for web:

- Target file size: < 200KB for backgrounds, < 100KB for icons
- Format: JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency

### Step 3: Add to Your Project
Place images in: `public/images/ai/`

Recommended filenames:
- `ai-hero-main.jpg` - Main hero image
- `ai-pattern-bg.jpg` - Pattern background
- `ai-innovation.jpg` - Innovation section
- `ai-sector-education.jpg` - Education sector
- `ai-sector-manufacturing.jpg` - Manufacturing sector
- (etc.)

### Step 4: Update Components
Replace SVG references with real images:

```tsx
// Instead of:
<img src="/images/ai/ai-hero.svg" alt="AI Neural Network" />

// Use:
<img src="/images/ai/ai-hero-main.jpg" alt="AI Neural Network" />
```
